# Multi-label Classification In Competitive Programming Based On CPG Representation

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Objective
The purpose of this project is to label the competitive programming problem through accurate C++ source codes, which were transformed into a Code Property Graph representation.

### Methods Used
* Source Code Representation (Abstract Syntax Tree, Control Flow Graph, Program Dependence Graph)
* Attention Mechanism
* Apriori Algorithm

## Requirements
### Code Preprocessing
* The GNU Compiler Collection (g++)
* [cppcheck]
* [tokenizer]
* [JOERN]
### Code Embedding
* [Code2vec]
* [Mocktail] - reimplemented

## Usage

## Evaluation
* Target: 28 algorithm labels (after EDA)
* Code Label Result: 0.44 (F1 Score Micro)
## Dataset
* The complete Dataset is available [here]
## Weights
* The weight after trainning [here]
